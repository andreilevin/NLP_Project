# Andrei's NLP Project Proposal

My plan is to make a recipe recommender:  the user inputs a list of ingredients or some other relevant info (cuisine, type of meal, time/ease of preparation, etc.)  and my recommender spits out a few recipes they might like that are most related to each other and to the request.  In the interest of recommending truly tasty recipes, I will filter an initial set of recipes based on number of reviews and average review score.  If this project does not end up being a disaster, I hope to also use it as a basis for a web app in the upcoming Data Engineering module project.  

I have not yet settled on a final dataset, but I've narrowed it down to three:

* https://www.kaggle.com/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews

* https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions

* http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu/

I am also not yet sure what recipe-specific documents I will be performing the NLP on : ingredients?  keywords?  recipe description?  recipe instructions?  several of the above?  Advice appreciated.
