# Andrei's NLP Project MVP

I am building a recipe recommender based on the following dataset from Kaggle, which has ~280k recipes scraped from Food.com:  https://www.kaggle.com/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews

In order to speed up computation speed and in the interest of only recommending excellent recipes, I filtered this dataset to keep only recipes with a 5-star rating and a minimum of 10 reviews.  This left me with ~22k recipes, an eminently manageable amount.

As a first pass, I word-tokenized the ingredients list of each recipe and ran it through a TF-IDF vectorizer and an NMF model with 15 topics.  This gave me the following topics, which don't look half bad (some are certainly bizarre though, like the blueberries, mayonnaise & salmon one...):

```

And here is the same thing but with a sentence tokenizer, using the entire ingredient phrase as the token.  Some weird results again (in topic 14, what are chicken breasts doing there?).  I'm wondering how I could consolidate some of these ingredients (eg, "BONELESS SKINLESS CHICKEN BREASTS" and "BONELESS SKINLESS CHICKEN BREAST HALVES" --> "CHICKEN" or "CHICKEN BREASTS")
