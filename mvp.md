# Andrei's NLP Project MVP

I am building a recipe recommender based on the following dataset from Kaggle, which has ~280k recipes scraped from Food.com:  https://www.kaggle.com/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews

In order to speed up computation speed and in the interest of only recommending excellent recipes, I filtered this dataset to keep only recipes with a 5-star rating and a minimum of 10 reviews.  This left me with ~22k recipes, an eminently manageable amount.

As a first pass, I word-tokenized the ingredients list of each recipe and ran it through a TF-IDF vectorizer and an NMF model with 15 topics.  This gave me the following topics, which don't look half bad (some are certainly bizarre though, like the blueberries, mayonnaise & salmon one...):
